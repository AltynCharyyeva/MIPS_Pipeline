# MIPS Pipeline Processor
This project implements a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) Pipeline Processor in VHDL (Hardware Description Language).


# Features:
- Pipeline Architecture: Utilizes a pipelined architecture to improve performance by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. The overall execution of an instruction is divided into stages(phases). After
an instruction passes the first phase for example the second instruction comes to the first phase, then the third and so on.
- Support for MIPS Instruction Set: Implements a subset of MIPS instructions.
- Basic Components: Includes essential pipeline stages such as Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).
